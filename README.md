# Connect4-App
A very basic connect4 app that I used to familiarise myself with Python.
Two players play on a single seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. Players should select a colour before the game starts.
Players take turns to select the column in which the player wants to drop its coloured/symbol disc. The pieces fall straight down occupying the next available space inside the column. 
The game validates the positions of the discs so they do not overlap.

The game also announces the winning player when a plyer connects four of its own discs of the same colour next to each other vertically or horizontally.
Text based user interface is used to play the game.
Computer player plays randomly.

The game can be restarted at any stage of the game.
The game can also announce the winning player who connects four of its own discs next to each other diagonally.
Computer player allows some time before it insert its disc e.g. 2 seconds, emulating its thinking period even if the subsequent move is random. 
Players can select the size of the grid at the beginning of the game.
